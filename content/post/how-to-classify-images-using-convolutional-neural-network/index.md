###### Abstract

**Convolution Neural Network (CNN)** are a feed-forward type of deep learning neural network. They are used to classify the data and are extensively used in making image classifiers, computer vision and video processing, audio and speech analysis, etc. The main difference in CNN and other matrix multiplication based neural networks is CNN uses *convolutions* in at least one layer of the neural network, i.e. takes it takes two functions and returns a function.

**CIFAR-10** dataset is a collection of 60000 32x32 labeled images divided into 10 classes, airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks, having 6000 images in each class. This dataset is one of the most commonly used dataset for making machine learning image classifiction algorithms and models. We would use this dataset for making our model. The dataset can be download from the kaggle link provided in the links below.
