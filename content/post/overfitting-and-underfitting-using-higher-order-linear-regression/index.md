#### Introduction and Objective

Our goal is explore and explain the concepts of model overfitting and underfitting using Higher Order Linear Regression. We are going to use Python modules PyTorch, NumPy and matplotlib to make and plot the results of our model. We would generate the data, divide it into train and test datasets, and then analyze it. The detailed problem statement can be found on the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/126p_RE60XSdpzmNWmO-OUOGsUbR-LczyYDQ9I4xnYAQ/edit#) by made my professor, [Dr. Deokgun Park](https://crystal.uta.edu/~park/), for the class CSE 5331 Data Mining.
